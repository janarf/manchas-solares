Hands-on, practical knowledge of how to use neural networks and deep learning with Keras 2.0

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are a biologically-inspired set of models that facilitate computers learning from observed data. Deep learning is a set of algorithms that use especially powerful neural networks. It is one of the hottest fields in data science, and most state-of-the-art results in robotics, image recognition and artificial intelligence (including the famous AlphaGo) use deep learning. This repository contain hands-on, practical knowledge of how to use neural networks and deep learning with Keras 2.0, the latest version of a cutting edge library for deep learning in Python.
